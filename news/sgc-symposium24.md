We are excited to announce that the Swiss Geocomputing Centre will organise a two-days symposium on [**Symposium on Bridging Modelling and Data Sciences**](https://unil-sgc.github.io/events/sgc-symposium24) to be held at the University of Lausanne (Unil) on November 21-22, 2024.

You will soon find the relevant information about the event: [**Symposium on Bridging Modelling and Data Sciences** (https://unil-sgc.github.io/events/sgc-symposium24)](https://unil-sgc.github.io/events/sgc-symposium24)

## Venue
This event will provide a platform for students and researchers to showcase their work and connect with actors from the public sector and leading tech companies. It aims to cultivate dialogue and potential collaborations in applied computational sciences within the geosciences.

The symposium will explore intersections across various computational disciplines, including geo-modelling, geospatial data sciences, GIS, and high-performance computing, with a focus on differentiable modelling, AI/ML, GPU-based processing, and effective research practices in reproducibility and open-source development.

This symposium aims to unite researchers and institutions through computational/spatial modelling expertise and collaborative opportunities. The symposium will further expand the on-going activities to include external experts. It will feature presentations, devote time for idea exchanges, and short courses led by industry leaders, focusing on geospatial sciences and GPU computing.

# Seminar Series 2024

The **First SGC Seminar Series** presents leading-edge research carried out by the members of the SGC Scientific Committee.

> The Swiss Geocomputing Centre (SGC) federates interdisciplinary research across geosciences. With a clear meaning of GeoComputing as emerging discipline at the intersection between geosciences and computation, our main purpose is to bring together researchers dealing with computational and modelling approaches and to promote related activities.

It will be held from 15:30 to 16:30 at Geopolis and followed by an informal apero :tada: !

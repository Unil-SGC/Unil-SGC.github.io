_by Ludovic Räss, Marj Tonini_

On Thursday 16 November will be held the general assembly of the Swiss Geocomputing Centre.

## Items to discuss

We will discuss the following items:
1. **Coffee meetings** - Organization of regular coffee meetings (once to twice a month) mainly addressed to PhD and Postdoc of our Faculty, about main topics in the domain of geocomputing (e.g., Open science and reproducibility - FAIR Principles; GitHub - version control and collaborative development; comparison of different program languages - R vs Python vs Julia).

2. **Budget** – Settle a yearly budget, ideally financed by the Institutes or the Faculty (via FINV), to support the activities of the Centre, such as seminars (possibility of inviting external speakers), workshops, infrastructures.

3. **SGC event** – Organization of a one- or two-day main event (seminars and workshops) to promote the activities related to the Centre.

4. **SGC direction** - The Director's term of office is 2 years, renewable for 3 consecutive terms. I propose the renewal of my mandate, and to add Ludovic (in addition to Christian) as vice-directors. These proposals must be approved by the Scientific Committee (SC).

5. **SGC reorganization** - According to the « Guidelines », any member of the Faculty can ask to be affiliated to the Centre, while the SC has a more active role in the management of the Centre. I propose to invite more researchers to be affiliated and, for you, to confirm if you wish remaining a member of the SC or to change your position as affiliated member.

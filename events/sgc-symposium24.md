## General information

The Swiss Geocomputing Centre (SGC) at the Faculty of Geosciences and Environment (FGSE), University of Lausanne (Unil), is organising a 2-day symposium, themed **Bridging Modelling and Data Sciences in the geosciences**. This event will provide a platform for students and researchers to showcase their work and connect with actors from the public private sectors. It aims to cultivate dialogue and potential collaborations in applied computational sciences within the geosciences.

The symposium will explore intersections across various computational disciplines, including geo-modelling, geospatial data sciences, GIS, and high-performance computing, with a focus on differentiable modelling, AI/ML, GPU-based processing, and effective research practices in reproducibility and open-source development. The 2-day symposium will be held in Autumn 2024, November 21 and 22, at Unil.

This symposium aims to unite researchers and institutions through computational/spatial modelling expertise and collaborative opportunities. The symposium will further expand the on-going activities to include external experts. It will feature presentations, devote time for idea exchanges, and offer short courses led by Nvidia, OSiRES and Ageospatial, focusing on geospatial sciences and GPU computing.

:bulb: Participants interested in joining this workshop will be required to register for that in order to have access to the GPU compute resources for the workshop.

#### Nvidia

#### OSiRES
In this workshop we will demonstrate and discuss the needs and challenges regarding the utilization of geospatial webservices for reproducible research.

#### Ageospatial
Building the future of GeoForge: An interactive workshop on Generative AI usage in geospatial data assisted disaster management

**Details:** Participants will have the opportunity to test the GeoForge proof of concept. Ageospatial aims to gather valuable feedback and collaborate on ideas on how this future platform can provide real value in tackling current challenges, especially in disaster management and risk fields. We'll present use cases and invite participants to propose concrete improvements and suggest architectures for new AI frameworks such as Agentic AI systems, RAG concepts, and LangChain frameworks.

**Instructor:** Maaz Sheikh

## Registration

The symposium is completely free of charge. On site, you will be able to attend whichever conferences
you like, but for logistical reasons please indicate through the form which sessions you are interested in.

:memo: **Register here:** (Link available upon registration's opening)

## Posters

If you wish to present your past or ongoing research with a poster on Friday afternoon, please indicate so in the registration form. There are still many slots available for poster presentations. We encourage you to sign up and to re-use a poster you did present at a recent conference or event!

The poster session will be divided into two parts. First, each presenter will give a 2-minute presentation on a screen to introduce their research and provide context. For the remainder of the afternoon, attendees will be free to walk around, ask questions, and create network connections.

### :coffee: What is this geocomputing coffee about?
During this second geocomputing coffee we plan to cover the material presented in the previous get-together but on slower pace: Git, GitHub, Remote-SSH via VS Code

> Find most of the material presented during the geocomputing coffee on GitHub [https://github.com/Unil-SGC/geocomputing-coffee](https://github.com/Unil-SGC/geocomputing-coffee).

### :computer: Hands-on
We will cover the material of the following tutorial [https://github.com/Unil-SGC/geocomputing-coffee/tree/main/1-git-demo](https://github.com/Unil-SGC/geocomputing-coffee/tree/main/1-git-demo) in slow motion:
- demo about the basics of using git, GitHub, and Julia
- syncing local and remote repos using git
- running interactively on `Curnagl` GPU node

### What's next?
Stay tuned (joining the SGC Discord server) about future geocomputing coffee! We plan to gather bi-weekly most probably on Thursday, 10h30 - 11h30 or 12h15 - 13h15.

## Swiss 3D models

In geosciences, 3D models are one of the most valuable data types, they are so versatile and can be used for many different applications. Below, a dataset with swiss 3D models : **swissALTI3D**, **swissSURFACE3D**, **swissSURFACE3D Raster**, **swissBATHY3D**, **DHM 25 and DHM/200m**. More information about the technical details for this dataset below.

- [swissALTI3D](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/geodata/height/alti3d.html): **swissALTI3D** is an extremely precise digital elevation model which describes the surface of Switzerland without vegetation and development. Application includes: 1) Height data-set in a geographic information system, 2) 3D visualisations, simulations and visibility analyses, 3) Mapping small structures and forest paths, 4) Planning tool in the fields of spatial planning, telecommunications, natural hazards and forestry, and 5) Ortho-rectification of aerial and satellite images.

It is essentially based on the 1:25,000 Swiss national map. DHM/200m can be used for larger scale processes as the grids are 200m big. The size of the grids for DHM25 are 25m big. DHM25 and DHM/200m can be used wherever computations of the topography of the earth’s surface are required. In other words, it is a basic dataset for geographic information systems. For example, it can be used for making calculations of terrain sections, simulating avalanches, constructing terrain models, carrying out visibility studies, planning telecommunication antennas or visualisations of landscapes. The range of potential uses is very broad.

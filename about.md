Welcome at the Swiss Geocomputing Centre (SGC) of the [Faculty of Geosciences and Environment](https://www.unil.ch/gse/fr/home/menuinst/faculte/english/studies-at-fgse.html), [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/index.html), Switzerland.

The recent development of quantitative methods allowing to perform intelligent data reduction and suitable analysis, as well as predictive process modelling, is a central issue in geo-environmental and socio-economic sciences. In these domains, numerical data are nowadays massively available and discovering interesting spatial or intrinsic patterns is a challenging task that led scientists to search for new tools. In parallel, scientists need to generate analytical and numerical solutions to quantify and predict complex physical-chemical processes.

To respond to these needs, the Swiss Geocomputing Centre federates interdisciplinary research across natural and human sciences, regrouping different domains of research from the geo- and environmental sciences into a dynamic and method oriented team.

With a definition of **geocomputing as emerging discipline at the intersection of geosciences and computation**, our main purpose is to bring together researchers dealing with computational and modelling approaches with respect to geo-environmental challenges and to promote related activities.

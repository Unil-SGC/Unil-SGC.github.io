### Executive team

[**Marj Tonini**](https://wp.unil.ch/geocomputing/home/people/executive-team/marj-tonini/) Director

> Marj Tonini is a spatial data scientist with a strong interest on geospatial modelling for risk assessment, mainly related to wildfires and landslides. Marj's research focuses on the development of innovative approaches to enable efficient learning from complex environmental datasets.

[**Christian Kaiser**](https://igd.unil.ch/ckaiser/en/presentation/) Vice-director

> Christian Kaiser is a specialist in geovisualisation, quantitative geography, GIS, geocomputation and data science. His research interests include topics of «Computational GIScience» and dynamic and interactive visualisation.

[**Ludovic Räss**](https://github.com/luraess) Vice-director

> Ludovic is a computational geoscientist with research interests focussing on the development and application of high-performance and scalable software tools to further understand the localisation of flow and deformation in ice and porous rocks.


### Scientific committee

[**Tom Beucler**](https://github.com/tbeucler)

> Tom's broad interests are atmospheric physics, deep learning, climate informatics and environmental fluid dynamics. He combine statistics, theory, numerical simulations and observational analyses to improve our understanding of meteorology and climate, and guide the development of operational models of storms and clouds.

[**Daniela Domeisen**](https://wp.unil.ch/atmos/people/daniela-domeisen/)

> Daniela's research focuses on an improved understanding of the dynamics and predictability of weather and climate through the study of extreme events, global remote connections, and interactions between components of the climate system using statistical tools, a hierarchy from simple to high performance numerical models, as well as data science.

[**György Hetényi**](https://wp.unil.ch/orog3ny/people/gyorgy-hetenyi/)

> György's research focuses on in the continental lithosphere: its structure, its deformation and the associated physical processes. His principal tools of investigation are geophysical imaging (seismology, gravimetry, drilling) and numerical modelling (themo-mechanical, petrological), including fieldwork.

[**Guillaume Jouvet**](https://jouvetg.github.io/)

> Guillaume's research interest spans from the mathematical aspects of ice flow models to the observation of glacial processes using drones.

[**Gregoire Mariethoz**](https://wp.unil.ch/gaia/team/gregoire-mariethoz/)

> Gregoire's research interests reside in the development of stochastic methods that characterize the spatial and temporal variability inherent to hydrological systems. He develop numerical techniques using high-order, non-parametric statistics, which allow for mining the full richness of modern datasets.

[**Stefan Schmalholz**](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1104631&LanCode=8)

> Stefan's main research interests are the quantification of geological processes with mathematical models that are based on the concepts of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, particularly the study of mountain building processes.

[**Céline Rozenblat**](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1048878&LanCode=8&menu=coord)

> Céline's research is widely directed on the relations between evolutions of powers and values and networks dynamics into systems of territories. In order to develop these topics in a comparative point of view, she built many large database on European cities and on networks since 1987.

### Assistants

[**Jacques Soutter**](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1265650&LanCode=8)

> Jacques assists the executive team of the Swiss Geocomputing Centre organising various events, being also a PhD student at IGD.

[**Haokun Liu**](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1265460&LanCode=8)

> Haokun is a student assistant in the Swiss Geocomputing Centre. His research focusses on the urban complexity, health geography and spatial data science.

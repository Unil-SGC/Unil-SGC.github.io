### :coffee: What is the geocomputing coffee about?
The geocomputing coffee aims at an informal get-together with people interested in – or curious about – the geocomputing thematic. The idea is to provide a relaxed venue to exchange and learn about computational-related topics and share your latest advances or discuss technical issues.

> Find most of the material presented during the geocomputing coffee on GitHub [https://github.com/Unil-SGC/geocomputing-coffee](https://github.com/Unil-SGC/geocomputing-coffee).

### :tada: Welcome
As a **first get-together**, the goal of this meeting is to:
- (Re)-introduce briefly the Swiss Geocomputing Centre (SGC)
  - Website [https://unil-sgc.github.io](https://unil-sgc.github.io)
  - GitHub organisation [https://github.com/Unil-SGC](https://github.com/Unil-SGC)
  - Discord chat server
- Introduce the activities we plan to offer within the SGC **geocomputing coffee**
- Provide a hands-on about version control and reproducible science using good-practices and tools for software carpentry.

### :computer: Hands-on
During this first meeting, we will also cover the following technical topics:
- demo about the basics of using git, GitHub, and Julia
- syncing local and remote repos using git
- running interactively on `Curnagl` GPU node

### What's next?
Stay tuned (joining the SGC Discord server) about future geocomputing coffee! We plan to gather bi-weekly most probably on Thursday, 10h30 - 11h30 or 12h15 - 13h15.
